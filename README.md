# NBA Research Project
Repository for NBA Research Project

This project was intended to record player statistics from game footage in an attempt to measure the impact of an individual star player on basketball games. Using these statistics, a model was trained to predict the outcome of a game based on a player's performance. A model with 80% accuracy was achieved, and can be found in the Classifiers notebook. 

Additionally, standard and advanced game statistics were used to define new roles for NBA players through the use of K-Means clustering. This can be found, alongside visualizations of the recorded player data, in the Altair notebook. 

Lastly, all visualizations and a few model predictions can be accessed in a web page format using the total.html file. 

Both notebooks can be run in google colab from start to finish.
